The greatest tragedy in life is not death, but a life without purpose.  
Change is inevitable but personal growth is a choice.  
The wealthiest place on earth is the cemetery because it is full of people who saved their talents and abilities.  
Don't set your goals by what other people deem important.  
True leadership is not about power but about service.  
The greatest tragedy is a life without purpose.  
Success is not just about making money; it is about making a difference.  
Your purpose is not your career. Your purpose is your life.  
To live a meaningful life, you must find your purpose and pursue it passionately.  
Leadership is the capacity to influence others through inspiration, not intimidation.
