## markovgen.py  
Char-level Markov chain text generator. Trains on your text to spit out statistically plausible gibberish. Supports variable n-grams and logs all the neccesary details.

## QRNG.py  
Quantum randomness powered by ANUâ€™s API. Because true randomness > pseudo. Perfect for crypto geeks, simulation junkies, and ideal for my quantitative simulations.
